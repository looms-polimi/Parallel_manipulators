  abstract  = {A new Modelica library for the modeling and simulation of 3-dimensional mechanical systems has been developed. It will be freely available in the Modelica standard library. Furthermore, the Dymola simulation environment has been considerably enhanced to support the needed features. The MultiBody library is first presented from a user?s point of view. Furthermore, all essential details of the implementation are described. The library includes features that are usually not available in other multi-body software, such as analytic handling of a large class of kinematical loops, or the arbitrary connection feature of objects. For example, series connection of 3D line force components is possible.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a novel 5-Degree of Freedom (DOF) Redundantly Actuated (RA) Parallel Kinematic Manipulator (PKM) called SPIDER4 is presented. The main purpose of this manipulator is to perform machining tasks such as drilling and milling. All the mathematical models including the forward and inverse kinematic models, as well as the inverse dynamic model were developed. Owing to machining tasks require high precision, a RISE Feedforward controller is proposed for desired trajectory tracking. To show the performance and effectiveness of the proposed control scheme, real-time experiments were performed. The obtained results of the proposed controller compared to the standard RISE controller are presented and discussed. They confirm that the proposed controller outperforms the standard one.},

Two alternative types of robots are presented here: parallel robots that can meet all technical requirements.},
